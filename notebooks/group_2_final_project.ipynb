    "# Investigating Observed Patterns of Ocean Temperature, Salinity, and Sea Level\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to investigate observed patterns of ocean temperature, salinity, and sea level. An in-depth analysis is done to better conceptualize these variables and put them into context of how they affect the climate. Observed ocean temperature and salinity data from World Ocean Atlas (WOA18) is compared to climate model output from GDFL- ESM4's historical experiment to assess model representation of ocean temperatures and salinity. This analysis was conducted by Grace Woolslayer (grace.woolslayer@temple.edu), Tyler Wassel (tyler.wassel@temple.edu), and Ryan Pszczolkowski (ryan.pszczolkowski@temple.edu).  "

    "Our planet is often referred to as the blue planet because over 70% of it is covered by water. It is where life first emerged and evolved into what it is today. Water has many unique properties that have allowed it to sustain life directly and indirectly. The ocean, more specifically, plays a vital role in mitigating the effects of climate change by slowing down the rate at which our planet warms. It can store excess heat due to its high specific heat capacity, depth, and circulation patterns. A high specific heat capacity is significant because it takes much more energy (heat) to change temperature by one degree Celsius.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The heat that is stored in the ocean is referred to as ocean heat content. The upper layers of the ocean experience greater accumulations of heat than the deeper parts of the water column but both have seen an increase in heat gain rates in the last few decades.  Ocean waves, tides, and currents in addition to large-scale circulation patterns help distribute heat from the surface to deeper, cooler levels. A rise in ocean heat content is a result of more heat being absorbed than released.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The heat that is absorbed will eventually find its way back into Earth’s system by melting ice shelves or reheating the atmosphere. Since water has a high specific heat and most of the heat, it can take decades until the effects of the absorbed heat are seen.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of how ocean heat is measured, scientists rely on sea surface heights to calculate heat content since water expands when it’s warmed. This concept is referred to as thermal expansion. To gain insights into ocean heat content at different depths, there are other methods similar to the ones mentioned above. Scientists can use CTDs, Argo floats, and even employ seals to capture temperatures at hard-to-get depths.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Heat content is commonly expressed in units of joules and anomalies are expressed in watts per square meter. The change in heat content is relatively small per square meter but the whole ocean must be considered, which is over 360 million square kilometers. Given that the heat content in the ocean will eventually be released, it is crucial to understand how much heat is being stored, how it is being transported, and how long it will take to be released. Heat content does not only affect sea levels but also the biochemistry of the ocean. \n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, increased heat in the ocean causes water to expand and decreases the solubility capacity for gases. Warm water cannot absorb as much gas, in this case carbon dioxide, as cold water. This also poses issues for global temperatures since that means that more carbon dioxide will reside in the atmosphere because of the decreased capacity of the ocean. More carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means higher global temperatures and the cycle continues.  \n",
